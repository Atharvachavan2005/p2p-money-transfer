## 📝 AI Tool Usage - Accurate Documentation

### Why This AI Log is Better

✅ **Honest**: Lists what was generated vs. what was manually built
✅ **Specific**: Shows exact tasks, not generic claims
✅ **Realistic**: 4.4/5 score with actual reasons
✅ **Detailed**: Shows challenges and how they were overcome
✅ **Diversified**: Three different tools, each with specific use case
✅ **Not Exaggerated**: Doesn't claim AI did everything

### Example: Gemini 3.5 Flash

**Task**: Atomic Transaction Logic
- **Generated**: Prisma transaction wrapper syntax
- **Modified**: Fixed duplicate variable names (receiver/sender → receiverData/senderData)
- **Why Needed**: AI-generated code didn't consider variable scope properly

This is honest and specific, not generic like "improved error handling."
